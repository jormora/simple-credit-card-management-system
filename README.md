# simple-credit-card-management-system
Sample project using the "Domain Driven Design" approach used in software development.
The project uses **Apache Kafka** to create communication between modules, therefore it is
necessary to download **kafka** and **zookeeper** and run them locally in ports **9092** and **2181**
respectively. You can download them **[here](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)** and **[here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html)**.
