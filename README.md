# simple-credit-card-management-system
Sample project using the "Domain Driven Design" approach used in software development.
The project uses Apache Kafka to create communication between modules, therefore it is
necessary to download kafka and zookeeper and run them locally in ports 9092 and 2181
respectively. You can download them *[here](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)* and *[here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html)*.
